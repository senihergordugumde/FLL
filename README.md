# FLL
A simple tool that i wrote with python give easiness for find latitude and longitude locations from an excel table or python list. For example this locations may like this( “İstanbul”, “İstanbul/Sefaköy”, “Sevim Sk. no: 12”, “Pera Müzesi” )

# Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to use

Basically we have 2 methods. Maybe you want to use your python list. So you can try this.

fll.findLocation(api,data,toExcel)

api = "Api that taken from Google"
data = Your data list in python
toExcel = It's a boolean variable. Do you want an excel file? If yes try True or 1
